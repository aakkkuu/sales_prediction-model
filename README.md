The task at hand is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sales of a big market's various products based on historical sales data and other relevant features. This predictive model aims to assist the market management in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning to optimize sales and enhance overall profitability.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sales volume of different products within the big market. This predictive model will leverage historical sales data along with other relevant features such as product attributes, store information, promotional activities, and seasonal trends to generate reliable sales forecasts.
